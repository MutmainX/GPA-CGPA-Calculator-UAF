- Optimized layout for mobile and desktop users.

#### **Inspiration Behind It**
Eight months into university, I found GPA calculations to be both confusing and unnecessarily time-consuming. The few calculators developed by seniors had limitations:
- Some relied on scraping the university’s site, which wasn’t always reliable (like when the website was down).
- Others had poor designs or included optional courses, leading to inaccurate results.
- Data privacy was also a concern.

I wanted a solution that would be simple, reliable, and user-focused.

#### **What Makes This Different**
- **Manual Input Only:** No automatic scraping, ensuring full control over your data.
- **No Ads or Limits:** Free forever, with zero distractions.
- **Accuracy First:** Only calculates based on the courses you add—no errors from “extra” subjects.

#### **Open Source and Free for Everyone**
This project is my first step toward building tools that are free, accessible, and serve the community. I strongly believe that code should benefit people, not profit, and that everyone deserves equal access to useful tools. Inspired by the open-source community, this tool aims to make life easier for students without any financial barriers..
